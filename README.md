# ToySwap
My newest Android project, the idea is to make an app which allows user to post an items offerings as used bikes, kids toys, clothes which are shown to other users like in normal trading app but also are stored in usersâ€™ inventory. Inventory feature allows users to make an offer for items that they are interested in as exchange of items. 
I consider the idea quite challenging but I'm taking my time into putting effort to make this app efficient, usable, easy to maintain and with clean code.
